The application aims to follow the life of the tires, if they are running or if they are in stock. It allows you to know the quantity of tires in stock according to the size and life of the tire (new or retread) with and without tire details. In the future, the application will make it possible to know for sure which vehicle the tires are mounted, to create works and to have a history on the works and to know on which vehicle the tires have rolled.
